# Classifying_Email_Spam_Ham
This repo contains the code that demonstrates predicting if the Email is Spam or not
 
Project Overview
•	Created a classifier tool that can predict if the given email is spam or not
•	Dataset obtained from Kaggle
•	Implemented BERT model for this classification problem
•	Have used the trained models that are already available in tensorflow hub website to solve this problem statement
•	A simple neural network has been used along with one Drop out layer and one Output layer
•	Achieved about 85-90% accuracy 
•	Model is trained well and is able to predict if the new give email  is spam or not
